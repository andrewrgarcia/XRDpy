# X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis with Python
## Andrew Garcia, 2018

XRDpy is in layman terms, an XRD pattern plotting program which calculates crystallite size
in an easy way. It is currently divided into 2 main scripts, XRDsingle.py and XRD.py, which
plot and calculate the Scherrer width for a single XRD and multiple XRD pattterns at a time,
respectively.
